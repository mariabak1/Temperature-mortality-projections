# Temperature-mortality-projections

The code reproduces the main analyses in the manuscript "Temperature-related mortality in Latin American cities under climate change and population scenarios". 

The code was adapted from "A hands-on tutorial on a modelling framework for projections of climate change impacts on health" by Ana M. Vicedo-Cabrera, Francesco Sera, Antonio Gasparrini downloaded from http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2019_vicedo-cabrera_Epidem.html. We relied on that code to tailor it to our study needs.
